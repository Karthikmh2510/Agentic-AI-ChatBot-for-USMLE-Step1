This exam assesses your understanding of basic concepts and their application to clinical medicine. Because this exam will focus on application, your study plan needs to make provision for understanding and not just cramming.\\\\n\\\\nThis post is not just another old-fashioned study schedule. It’s a guide to building a study plan that is results-driven and uses modern technology to help you achieve the results you want.\\\\n\\\\nBuilding a Custom Study Schedule\\\\n--------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n### Assess your baseline\\\\n\\\\nBefore you start studying, it’s always beneficial to assess your baseline. This will help you understand where you are in terms of studying and what areas will need focus. There are many ways to do this, such as using [NBME self-assessments](https://www.nbme.org/examinees/self-assessments), [Q-banks](https://www.lecturio.com/medical/usmle-step-1/qbank/), or AI-generated insights on your readiness.\\\\n\\\\nHere are some AI prompts you can use to give you an assessment of your baseline understanding:\\\\n\\\\n1.   _Ask me 10 questions that cover all major areas of USMLE content. Based on my performance, suggest which resource I should prioritize for each subject._\\\\n2.   _Ask me to list which organ systems I find most intuitive and which I find most confusing. For each one, ask me to describe:_\\\\n    *   _One topic I could teach someone else_\\\\n    *   _One concept I often mix up_\\\\n    *   _Whether I understand how it connects to other systems_\\\\n\\\\n_Summarize the responses into ‘well-integrated’, ‘needs integration,’ and ‘poorly understood’ systems_ _._\\\\n\\\\n### How to set up a realistic study timeline\\\\n\\\\nHere are study plans based on how much time you have to prepare for your exam and what your baseline knowledge is:\\\\n\\\\nThe 3-month study plan The 6-Month study plan The 12-month study plan\\\\n**Works well** if you have a foundational understanding and need intensive, focused preparation.\\\\n\\\\n**Weeks 1–6: foundational review**\\\\n\\\\n_Daily Focus:_\\\\n\\\\nWatch Boards and Beyond videos.\\\\n\\\\nReview the corresponding sections in First Aid.\\\\n\\\\nUse Anki for active recall of the main concepts.\\\\n\\\\n**Weeks 7–10: integration and practice**\\\\n\\\\n_Daily focus:_\\\\n\\\\nDo UWorld questions, focusing on mixed topics.\\\\n\\\\nReview incorrect questions.\\\\n\\\\nStart taking practice exams to assess your progress.\\\\n\\\\n**Weeks 11–12: final review**\\\\n\\\\n_Activities:_\\\\n\\\\nComplete the remaining UWorld questions.\\\\n\\\\nTake NBME practice exams and UWSA assessments.\\\\n\\\\nReview high-yield topics and weak areas identified in practice tests.\\\\n\\\\nSee our[99-Day Study Schedule for USMLE® Step 1](https://cdn.lecturio.com/assets/99-Day-Study-Schedule-for-USMLE-Step-1.pdf).**Works well** if you need a balanced approach that will give time for in-depth study and concept reinforcement.\\u200b\\\\n\\\\n**Months 1–2: comprehensive review**\\\\n\\\\n_Daily focus:_\\\\n\\\\nStudy foundational subjects.\\\\n\\\\nUse resources like First Aid, Pathoma, and Sketchy.\\\\n\\\\nBegin doing 1 UWorld block per day.\\u200b\\\\n\\\\n**Months 3–4: system-based study**\\\\n\\\\n_Daily focus:_\\\\n\\\\nDeep dive into organ systems: Cardio, Neuro, GI, etc.\\\\n\\\\nIncrease UWorld practice to 2 blocks per day.\\\\n\\\\nRegularly review and update Anki decks.\\u200b\\\\n\\\\n**Months 5–6: assessment and refinement**\\\\n\\\\n_Activities:_\\\\n\\\\nComplete NBME practice exams to identify weak areas.\\\\n\\\\nFocus on high-yield topics and frequently missed questions.\\\\n\\\\nFinalize your study with comprehensive reviews and practice tests.**Works well** for International Medical Graduates or those who need more time\\\\n\\\\n**Months 1–3: foundational knowledge**\\\\n\\\\n_Focus:_\\\\n\\\\nStudy basic sciences.\\\\n\\\\nUse [Lecturio](https://app.lecturio.com/#/) lectures and notes for a deeper understanding of each section.\\\\n\\\\nBegin Anki for long-term retention.\\\\n\\\\n**Months 4–6: organ systems**\\\\n\\\\n_Daily focus:_\\\\n\\\\nStudy major organ systems.\\\\n\\\\nIntegrate Pathoma and First Aid into your daily study.\\\\n\\\\nStart practicing by doing 1 UWorld block per day\\\\n\\\\n**Months 7–9: advanced topics and integration**\\\\n\\\\n_Daily focus:_\\\\n\\\\nCover remaining systems.\\\\n\\\\nIncrease UWorld practice to 2 blocks per day.\\\\n\\\\nStart practice exams to assess readiness.\\\\n\\\\nReview incorrect answers.\\\\n\\\\n**Months 10–12: final preparation**\\\\n\\\\n_Activities:_\\\\n\\\\nComplete UWorld questions.\\\\n\\\\nTake UWSA assessments and Free 120.\\\\n\\\\nFocus on weak areas and high-yield topics.\\\\n\\\\nRest and mentally prepare before the exam.\\\\n\\\\nThe balance between active and passive learning\\\\n-----------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nWhen studying USMLE Step 1, you need to balance active and passive learning. [Passive learning](https://www.asuprepdigital.org/student_blog/passive-learning-vs-active-learning/) learning is where you absorb information provided by an instructor or a textbook, without actively interacting with it. [Active learning](https://teaching.berkeley.edu/teaching-guides-resources/teaching-your-course/active-learning) is a study method in which you actively engage in learning. Balancing these two methods of learning allows you to use the benefits of each technique in a way that works with your learning style and the subject matter.\\\\n\\\\nHigh-Yield Resources: What to Use & What to Skip\\\\n------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nThere are so many online resources you can use to prepare for your USMLE Step 1 exam, and I’m sure you’re wondering what to use and what to skip. Don’t worry, we’ve researched for you, and we’re going to explain how to use each one to get the best score.\\\\n\\\\n### AI-augmented study tools\\\\n\\\\nIn 2025, we have modern AI tools that can help make your exam preparation so much simpler, but don’t use AI to replace traditional studying. Use AI to automate repetition, simulate questions, and create reports based on where you are in your understanding.\\\\n\\\\n#### Lecturio\\\\n\\\\nAt [Lecturio](https://www.lecturio.com/), we combine video lectures, quiz questions, and AI-driven spaced repetition. Our resources work really well for visual learners who want a structured study plan with integrated assessments and feedback.\\\\n\\\\n#### ChatGPT and other AI Platforms\\\\n\\\\nUse ChatGPT and other AI platforms to generate clinical scenarios or patient cases, quiz you on weak topics, and create rapid-recall drills based on your First Aid or Pathoma notes.\\\\n\\\\nTip for using AI in your learning:_Don’t just read or click. Type answers, explain your thinking, and ask follow-up questions or explanations to help you form an understanding of each topic._\\\\n\\\\n### Avoiding resource overload: the 80/20 Rule for high-yield learning\\\\n\\\\nWhen you’re preparing for USMLE Step 1, more isn’t always better. There are so many resources out there, and it’s easy to fall into the trap of trying to do everything.\\\\n\\\\nUse the 80/20 rule: roughly 80% of your score will come from 20% of the most high-yield material.\\\\n\\\\nInstead of spreading yourself thin, focus on core resources and use other tools only if you need clarification. When you wonder what tool to use, ask yourself:\\\\n\\\\n*   Is this resource helping me actively learn, or just making me feel productive?\\\\n*   Am I reviewing the same topic in three places when one would be enough?\\\\n\\\\nAI and Efficiency Hacks\\\\n-----------------------\\\\n\\\\nWe’ve already discussed how AI can make a major difference in how you approach the USMLE. But there are some other ways that AI can make your studying easier and faster.\\\\n\\\\n### Using AI-generated explanations for weak topics\\\\n\\\\nIf you find that you are stuck on a concept, instead of rewatching a video or rereading the textbook, ask AI to explain it to you. AI tools like ChatGPT can:\\\\n\\\\n*   **Break down complex topics** into simpler language or analogies.\\\\n*   **Explain the same idea multiple ways** until it sticks.\\\\n*   **Compare and contrast confusing concepts** (e.g., nephritic vs. nephrotic syndrome).\\\\n*   **Help you quiz yourself** or simulate a teach-back session.\\\\n\\\\nExample AI prompt:\\\\n\\\\n_“Explain the difference between T and B cells like I’m in first-year med school.”_\\\\n\\\\nUse AI as a study buddy but not a crutch. Remember always to fact-check important explanations with trusted resources.\\\\n\\\\n### Automating spaced repetition\\\\n\\\\n[Spaced repetition](https://www.bcu.ac.uk/exams-and-revision/best-ways-to-revise/spaced-repetition) is a scientifically proven study technique where you review material at gradually increasing intervals. This helps strengthen your memory over time and makes it less likely that you’ll forget what you’ve learned. It has been shown to improve long-term retention and reduce the total hours needed to study.\\\\n\\\\nAlthough spaced repetition is a great way to study and reduces the total hours needed on a topic, it can be a time-consuming process to keep track of. AI tools can track what you forget, prioritize what you need, and optimize review timing, saving you precious time.\\\\n\\\\n#### Lecturio smart spaced repetition:\\\\n\\\\nOur platform tracks your quiz performance and automatically pushes weak topics into your review schedule.\\\\n\\\\n#### AI-based flashcard generators:\\\\n\\\\nAI platforms like ChatGPT can help create flashcards directly from your notes, lectures, or UWorld explanations. Just paste in a topic and ask it to generate cloze-style or concept cards.\\\\n\\\\nIf you combine AI with spaced repetition, you can free up time and get progress reviews with less effort, so that you can focus on application-based studying.\\\\n\\\\nQBanks and Active Recall: The Science of Retention\\\\n--------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nAfter studying your concepts, it’s important to test whether you can recall and apply the information. That’s where question-based learning comes in. If you spend the bulk of your study time answering questions, you’re training your brain to retrieve and apply knowledge under pressure, just like you’ll need to on exam day.\\\\n\\\\n[Studies](https://ctl.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/KarpickeBlunt2011.pdf) show that active recall and retrieval practice lead to stronger retention than passive methods. Whether you’re getting questions right or wrong, the process forces you to think, analyze, and learn from feedback. Doing questions isn’t just review, it’s actually studying.\\\\n\\\\n### The best way to approach Qbanks\\\\n\\\\nQuestion banks, when used correctly, can be really beneficial in your USMLE preparation, but sometimes students make mistakes that can limit the benefits of Qbanks.\\\\n\\\\n### Common mistakes\\\\n\\\\n*   Saving questions for “later” instead of starting early\\\\n*   Treating questions like a test, not a learning opportunity\\\\n*   Focusing on the correct answer, and not on the reasoning behind all answers\\\\n*   Speeding through explanations without reviewing related information\\\\n*   Not tracking mistakes, so the same gaps resurface again and again\\\\n\\\\n### How to use Qbanks better\\\\n\\\\n*   Start early and don’t wait until you’ve “covered everything”\\\\n*   Use tutor mode for your first pass to learn as you go\\\\n*   Read every explanation, not just the one you chose\\\\n*   Integrate important points into First Aid and your flashcards\\\\n*   Review weak topics weekly\\\\n\\\\n### How to review incorrect Qbank answers\\\\n\\\\nSometimes, when you’re rushing to learn all your topics, you might feel like you only have time to skim over incorrect QBank answers. When doing Qbanks, don’t just look at what you got wrong, spend time learning why you got it wrong. Here’s a step-by-step on how to review your Qbank answers.\\\\n\\\\n#### Step 1: Read the full explanation (not just the correct option)\\\\n\\\\nEven if you think you “almost had it”, read the entire explanation. Understand why each distractor was incorrect and what clues ruled them out. This information will be helpful when you take the exam because you have learned how to rule out options correctly.\\\\n\\\\n#### Step 2: Identify how you make mistakes\\\\n\\\\nAsk yourself:\\\\n\\\\n*   Did I misread the question?\\\\n*   Was it a knowledge gap?\\\\n*   Did I overthink it or rush?\\\\n*   Did I fall for a test-taking trap?\\\\n\\\\n#### Step 3: Summarize the core learning point\\\\n\\\\nBriefly explain why the correct answer is right. If you can’t teach it, you haven’t learned it.\\\\n\\\\n#### Step 4: Link it to a resource\\\\n\\\\nHighlight the incorrect answer in First Aid, add it to your Anki deck, or write it down in your notes or QBank journal. This makes it easier to review later without having to re-read the full explanation.\\\\n\\\\n#### Step 5: Revisit incorrect answers in 1–3 days\\\\n\\\\nFlag the question or learning point and revisit it in a few days. This is considered spaced repetition, and it helps when you focus on your weakest points.\\\\n\\\\nLast-Minute Strategy and Test-Taking Tips\\\\n-----------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n### The 1-week cram plan\\\\n\\\\nBeing short on time doesn’t mean you’re out of options. Here is a 7-day cram plan to help you make the best of the week before your exam.\\\\n\\\\n1.   Focus on active recall and practice questions rather than on passive review\\\\n2.   Stick to high-yield topics only\\\\n3.   Use spaced repetition for retention\\\\n4.   Focus on your daily goals\\\\n5.   Schedule a practice test a day or two before the real thing\\\\n\\\\nRemember, you won’t be able to learn everything in a week, but you can make the most of the time you have.\\\\n\\\\n### Simulation and test-day mental preparation\\\\n\\\\nTest day is a marathon. It not only tests your knowledge but also your mental endurance. As you know, Step 1 is an 8-hour exam, and if you don’t spend time working on your stamina, even if you’re well-prepared, you might burn out halfway.\\\\n\\\\nStart simulating full-length exams at least a month or two before your actual test by using practice exams or back-to-back UWorld blocks. Time yourself strictly, sit at a desk, and avoid distractions. When you’re doing a test simulation, treat it like the real thing. Wake up before your scheduled exam time, eat your test-day breakfast, and follow the same break routine you plan to use on your test day.\\\\n\\\\nBreak management needs to be part of your strategy. Plan how you will take your breaks before the time. When you take a break, use the time to refocus. Make sure you hydrate, eat something, and mentally prepare for the next blocks.\\\\n\\\\nTrain as if you’re training for a sporting event. Start small and do one or two blocks a day, and gradually work up to doing three or four in a row. In the weeks before your test, try to complete at least one or two full simulations. This kind of training helps to reduce the anxiety of the unknown and smooth out energy dips. Without this kind of training, you might peak early and fade in your final blocks, and this is where scores often dip.\\\\n\\\\nConclusion\\\\n----------\\\\n\\\\nStudying for the USMLE Step 1 involves forming clinical reasoning and test-day resilience. Whether you have 3 months or a full year to prepare, your success depends heavily on choosing the right resources, using active learning strategies, and staying consistent.\\\\n\\\\n### Here’s a summary of how you can start preparing for the USMLE\\\\n\\\\n1.   Assess your baseline with a self-reflection or AI-guided audit\\\\n2.   Choose 2–3 core resources and stick to them\\\\n3.   Spend 80% of your time on active recall\\\\n4.   Use AI tools to explain weak topics, automate studying, and simulate questions\\\\n5.   Start doing full-length simulations at least a month before your exam\\\\n6.   Review incorrect QBank answers thoroughly, not just quickly\\\\n7.   Track your energy, progress, and burnout symptoms weekly\\\\n\\\\nReady to start preparing?\\\\n-------------------------\\\\n\\\\nIf you’re looking for a powerful platform to combine videos, quizzes, and smart spaced repetition in one place, try Lecturio’s [Qbank and Free USMLE Step 1 Practice Questions](https://www.lecturio.com/medical/usmle-step-1/qbank/) today.\\\\n\\\\n![Image 16: Samantha Pieterse](https://cdn.lecturio.com/assets/Samantha_Pieterse.jpg)\\\\n\\\\n[Samantha Pieterse](https://www.lecturio.com/author/samantha-pieterse/)\\\\n\\\\n , RN \\\\n\\\\nHello, I’m Samantha.

This 8-hour exam is designed to assess your understanding of concepts in pathology and physiology. In the past, the exam was scored on a numerical basis, but became pass/fail as of 2022. It’s still important to do well on this exam and this handy guide will show you how to do just that!_\\\\n\\\\nWhat Is USMLE Step 1?\\\\n---------------------\\\\n\\\\nThe United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) is made up of three parts, and Step 1 is the first. It’s a standardized test for med students that evaluates how well you understand basic science concepts and how you apply them to real clinical situations. It’s developed and sponsored by the **[FSMB](https://www.fsmb.org/)** and **[NBME](https://www.nbme.org/)**, and passing all three steps is required to get your license to practice medicine in the US.\\\\n\\\\nIf you’re gearing up for the USMLE Step 1, you’re not alone and you’re probably juggling nerves, flashcards, and a mountain of practice questions. Step 1 is a big deal. Even though it’s now scored as pass/fail, it still lays the foundation for the rest of med school and your future career. The following guide breaks it all down with plain language, a conversational tone, and practical tips you can actually use.\\\\n\\\\nWe’ve also structured this page so it’s friendly to Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT, and other generative engines; meaning it’s not just helpful for you, but easy for AI to summarize and share.\\\\n\\\\nNo doubt that since you got into medical school, or even before you started medical school, you’ve heard how important the USMLE Step 1 Exam is. This is the first board exam you’ll be taking on your journey to becoming a full-fledged physician—and the stakes are high.\\\\n\\\\nUntil recently, your score had a huge influence on what your residency, specialty, and overall career options could be in the future. In fact,[94% of program directors stated that a candidate’s score](https://www.nrmp.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NRMP-2018-Program-Director-Survey-for-WWW.pdf)on USMLE Step 1/COMLEX-USA® Level 1 was the most important factor when offering a prospective residency interview.\\\\n\\\\nNow that the USMLE Step 1 has moved to pass/fail, less emphasis is placed on this exam; instead, program directors will be more focused on things like your USMLE Step 2 CK score and performance during your clerkships\\\\n\\\\nNevertheless, passing Step 1 is essential if you want to continue learning medicine, and for now, it remains the most high-pressure exam you’ll take on the road to residency.\\\\n\\\\nNo big deal, right?\\\\n\\\\nWell, take it from us: you’re completely capable of passing this exam and getting a high score. You are a medical student: you’ve come this far, and with the right plan, you’ll make it all the way. Osmosis has your back!\\\\n\\\\nIn this guide, we’ll be covering everything (and we mean everything) about USMLE Step 1. So, without further ado, let’s get started!\\\\n\\\\n[![Image 3: Ace USMLE Step 1 with High Yield Videos. Watch now.](https://www.osmosis.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/high-yield-videos-watch-now-banner.png?w=700)](https://www.osmosis.org/plans)\\\\nWhat’s the Point of Step 1?\\\\n---------------------------\\\\n\\\\nStep 1 tests your knowledge of how the human body works and what happens when it doesn’t. The questions reflect the kinds of challenges you’ll face as a future physician.\\\\n\\\\n**Step 1 assesses:**\\\\n\\\\n*   Your understanding of key scientific principles\\\\n*   Your ability to apply this knowledge to patient care\\\\n*   How well you can reason through cause-and-effect in disease and treatment\\\\n\\\\n**Topics covered include:**\\\\n\\\\n*   Anatomy\\\\n*   Physiology\\\\n*   Pathology\\\\n*   Pharmacology\\\\n*   Biochemistry\\\\n*   Microbiology\\\\n*   Behavioral science\\\\n*   Genetics, Immunology\\\\n*   Biostats, Epidemiology\\\\n*   Medical ethics, nutrition, aging\\\\n\\\\nStep 1 emphasizes physiology, pharmacology, and pathology, which are the “high-yield” topics that show up most often. Questions are often integrated, meaning a single question may touch on multiple systems or processes.\\\\n\\\\nWhy Step 1 Still Matters\\\\n------------------------\\\\n\\\\nEven though there’s no number on your score report, Step 1 still matters:\\\\n\\\\n*   You need to pass to move forward\\\\n*   Some programs still take your testing timeline and retakes into account\\\\n\\\\nIt builds the foundation for Step 2 CK and clinical reasoning\\\\n\\\\nWhen should you take it?\\\\n------------------------\\\\n\\\\nMost students take Step 1 between their second and third year of med school—after preclinical coursework and before starting clinical rotations. Aim to take it:\\\\n\\\\n*   About 4–8 weeks after finishing basic sciences\\\\n*   After a 1–2 month dedicated study period\\\\n\\\\nWhat’s on the USMLE Step 1 exam?\\\\n--------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nStep 1 is a multiple-choice computerized test that you’ll take at a designated exam center. The exam is divided into seven “blocks,” each containing up to 40 questions that will test your medical knowledge and your analytical skills. You will have one hour to complete each “block.”\\\\n\\\\n### What skills will the Step 1 exam test me on?\\\\n\\\\nIn general, USMLE Step 1 will require you to:\\\\n\\\\n*   Utilize your understanding of basic scientific principles to solve clinical problems\\\\n*   Analyze and interpret data (graphs, tables, oscillation media, etc.)\\\\n*   Recognize both normal and pathological processes from gross and microscopic specimens.\\\\n\\\\n### What topics are covered on Step 1?\\\\n\\\\nUSMLE Step 1 covers a range of didactic topics, and evaluates you on a series of physician tasks and competencies as well:\\\\n\\\\n![Image 4](https://www.osmosis.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/usmle-step-1-coverage-graph.png?w=1024)\\\\n### How are different topics weighted on USMLE Step 1?\\\\n\\\\nTest items are divided into**Systems**and**Processes**as follows:\\\\n\\\\n![Image 5](https://www.osmosis.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/system-topics.jpg?w=1024)\\\\nWhat’s the Format Like?\\\\n-----------------------\\\\n\\\\nHere’s what you can expect:\\\\n\\\\n*   A single-day exam\\\\n*   8 hours of total testing\\\\n*   7 blocks of up to 40 multiple-choice questions\\\\n*   Up to 280 questions in total\\\\n*   Each block gives you 60 minutes to work\\\\n*   You get at least 45 minutes of break time\\\\n*   There’s an optional 15-minute tutorial\\\\n\\\\nYou’ll take it at a Prometric test center on a computer. Bring your ID and scheduling permit, and make sure to plan your breaks strategically so you can perform at your best.\\\\n\\\\nWhere and How to Register\\\\n-------------------------\\\\n\\\\n*   **U.S. and Canadian students**: Sign up through the **[NBME](https://www.myusmle.org/s/login/?ec=302&startURL=%2Fs%2F)**\\\\n*   **International students**: Go through the **[ECFMG](https://secure2.ecfmg.org/emain.asp?app=iwa)**\\\\n*   Schedule your exam and choose your testing center on the Prometric website\\\\n\\\\nHow Much Does It Cost?\\\\n----------------------\\\\n\\\\nThe registration fee as of 2025 is **$680** (we recommend you [check the NBME site to confirm](https://www.nbme.org/examinees/united-states-medical-licensing-exam-usmle#exam-fees)). If you’re testing outside the U.S. through ECFMG, there will likely be [additional fees](http://www.ecfmg.org/fees/index.html).\\\\n\\\\nWhat About Accommodations?\\\\n--------------------------\\\\n\\\\nIf you need extra time, breaks, or other support, apply early through the NBME or ECFMG. These requests are confidential and can make a big difference in the outcome of your exam. Refer to the [NBME website](https://www.usmle.org/what-to-know/test-accommodations) to make accommodation requests.\\\\n\\\\nUSMLE Step 1 Test Scores and Exam Length\\\\n----------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n### What score do I need to pass Step 1?\\\\n\\\\nOn February 12, 2020, the NRMP announced that scoring for USMLE Step 1 will be changed to pass/fail. The transition from numeric scoring to pass/fail began with exams taken on or after January 26, 2022. To learn more, visit USMLE.org.\\\\n\\\\n### How long is the Step 1 exam?\\\\n\\\\nThe whole Step 1 exam takes about 8 hours, broken down as follows:\\\\n\\\\n*   **Tutorial:**15 minutes (optional—more on that later)\\\\n*   **Breaks:**45 minutes\\\\n*   **7 Testing blocks:**60 minutes per block (~1.5 minutes per question)\\\\n\\\\nThere are some nuances around breaks that we’ll cover in more detail in the Step 1 Logistics section later in this article.\\\\n\\\\n![Image 6: Test time breakdown](https://www.osmosis.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/test-time-breakdown.png)\\\\nWhat’s the best way to study for USMLE Step 1?\\\\n----------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nNow that you have a sense of what you’re going to be tested on, it’s time to come up with a strategy for how you’re going to learn all this information for the exam.\\\\n\\\\nStudying for Step 1 isn’t like studying for any other exam you’ve taken. You need to know two years’ worth of medical school information inside and out. Solidifying your knowledge of this gargantuan amount of complex information requires a game plan.\\\\n\\\\n### 1. Develop Effective Learning Habits\\\\n\\\\nLearning is a science, and there are many proven techniques that will make your life a whole lot easier in the lead-up to Step 1. Osmosis Research Director[Dr. Sean Tackett](https://www.osmosis.org/profile/sean-tackett)developed a full course on learning science.[How to Learn in Medical School](https://university.osmosis.org/)helps students become better learners using six proven learning science techniques:\\\\n\\\\n1.   [Testing effect](https://www.osmosis.org/learn/Testing_effect)\\\\n2.   [Spaced repetition](https://www.osmosis.org/learn/Spaced_repetition)\\\\n3.   [Interleaving](https://www.osmosis.org/learn/Interleaved_practice)\\\\n4.   [Multimedia learning](https://www.osmosis.org/learn/Multimedia_learning)\\\\n5.   Elaborative interrogation\\\\n6.   Concrete examples\\\\n\\\\n#### A Little Note on Spaced Repetition\\\\n\\\\nSpaced repetition is a big part of why learning by Osmosis is so effective. But what is spaced repetition and how does it work?\\\\n\\\\nSpaced repetition is the act of retrieving knowledge at increasing intervals to reduce forgetting and enhance long-term learning. Essentially, you’re reviewing information repeatedly over time to burn it into your long-term memory.\\\\n\\\\nTiming this manually can be difficult, which is why technology-enhanced learning is so effective. The Osmosis platform uses a spaced repetition algorithm to test you on key information at optimal times to aid memory retrieval and help you build a knowledge foundation that will last for a lifetime.\\\\n\\\\n### 2. How to Pick a Few Good Resources and Stick to Them\\\\n\\\\nThere’s a glut of study resources out there for Step 1, and it can be tough to find the right fit. Some students will oversaturate themselves with resources—this trial and error process can mean a lot of wasted time early in the study period. So how do you choose?\\\\n\\\\nThe UFAP study resources (UWorld®, First Aid®, Pathoma®) are great, but**UFAPO**—combining the resources with Osmosis—is even better. Think of Osmosis as your HQ and right-hand person for this momentous challenge ahead of you. All of the UFAP resources can be integrated into the Osmosis Study Schedule for a completely seamless learning experience that covers all of your bases.\\\\n\\\\nWith Osmosis, you’ll also have the additional support of our[extensive video library](https://www.osmosis.org/home/dashboard), which brings to life the topics covered in First Aid and UWorld’s question explanations—allowing you to have a better grasp of the material and be more confident on the day of your Step 1 exam.\\\\n\\\\nThese videos cover important topics like basic sciences, biostatistics, epidemiology, pharmacology, microbiology, pathology, physiology, and more. Once you’ve watched the pathology videos, you can kick your studying into high gear with our High Yield Pathology series,which has been specifically designed to highlight all of the important concepts needed for the USMLE Step 1.\\\\n\\\\nAdditionally, Osmosis also has 3,000+ USMLE Step 1-style practice questions on pre-clerkship subjects including pathology, anatomy, physiology, microbiology, and pharmacology. As of December 2022, the Osmosis medical assessment team completed a thorough audit of thousands of board-style questions, with the goal of reviewing to ensure that every question is patient-first, inclusive, and aligned with what students need to know to be successful on your board exams.\\\\n\\\\nAdditionally, Osmosis also has flashcards, questions, and[High-Yield Notes](https://www.osmosis.org/product/high-yield-notes)that can further assist you in your mastery of your preclinical knowledge.\\\\n\\\\nEvery learner will take a different approach with regard to how they use these resources. In our next section, we’ll go over some general tips to steer you on the right path.\\\\n\\\\n![Image 7: A student reviewing the material.](https://www.osmosis.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/student-reviewing.png)\\\\n#### Start Reviewing Early\\\\n\\\\nThe sooner you start studying for Step 1, the better. You should be regularly reviewing concepts you’ve already learned throughout the year to ingrain them into your long-term memory. This will save you time during your dedicated study period, as you’ll already be building on a strong base of knowledge.\\\\n\\\\nSome students like to start studying very early on and take a practice exam before their dedicated study period begins.[NBME self-assessments](https://www.nbme.org/Students/sas/sas.html)will highlight your weak areas, giving you a better idea of where you should focus your studying.\\\\n\\\\n#### Go Through Each Resource as Many Times as You Need\\\\n\\\\nA quick Google search will reveal endless Step 1 prep strategies from students—you have to pick what’s right for you. A general rule for knowing if you’ve studied a topic enough is to try explaining the concepts to someone. If the information comes easily, you’ve learned it; if you find yourself struggling, you still have work to do.\\\\n\\\\n#### Focus on Classical Presentations of Diseases\\\\n\\\\nWhen you’re studying pathology for the exam, focus specifically on the typical presentations of diseases, as the exam will only test you on these. If you try to think about all the possible ways a condition can manifest, you will end up overthinking things and potentially trip yourself up. Familiarize yourself with the basics and trust your gut.\\\\n\\\\n#### Stop Studying When You Feel Like You’re Running Out of Steam\\\\n\\\\nIf you’ve been studying for over 10 hours and feel like things just aren’t sticking anymore, chances are, they aren’t. You might have a classmate flexing about pulling regular all-night sessions, but you don’t know how much of that time is actually productive.\\\\n\\\\nSome students feel “guilty” about taking study breaks. If it helps, consider breaking up your study periods with other “productive” activities, like exercise or meal prep. Whatever you do, step away from the books, and close your computer—you need this time to absorb the knowledge you’re trying to retain. It’s all part of the process!\\\\n\\\\n#### Don’t Panic If You See a Classmate Using a Resource You’re Not Using\\\\n\\\\nAs we’ve mentioned already, everyone will take a slightly different approach to learning for Step 1. Find the resources that work for you, and stick with them.\\\\n\\\\n[![Image 8: The most powerful platform for learning medicine and the health sciences Try it now button.](https://www.osmosis.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/health-medicine-try-it-now.png?w=700)](https://www.osmosis.org/plans)\\\\n### 3. Learn How to Break Down USMLE-style Practice Questions\\\\n\\\\nKnowing your systems and processes inside and out is just one aspect of studying for Step 1. You’ll also need to be familiar with how USMLE® questions are structured so you can quickly eliminate incorrect answer options and make the best choice.\\\\n\\\\nOsmosis has several resources that show you how to develop the right mindset to ace Step 1 questions:\\\\n\\\\n*   [How to Ace Med School & The USMLE with Dr. Maddison Caterine](https://www.osmosis.org/events)\\\\n*   [Breaking Down USMLE Step 1 Questions with Dr. Justin Ling](https://www.osmosis.org/events)\\\\n\\\\nWhen you’re done with these resources, try putting your learnings into action with the Osmosis Q-Bank, which contains more than 3,00+ Step 1-style practice questions.\\\\n\\\\n[**→Get started with the Osmosis Question Bank.**](https://www.osmosis.org/qbank/med)\\\\n\\\\n### 4. Make Effective Use of Flashcards\\\\n\\\\nFlashcards are a convenient way to learn a high volume of information quickly. They’re best suited for learning individual facts rather than interconnected concepts, and they’re a great way to study on the go.\\\\n\\\\nOsmosis has over 16,500 flashcards built into the platform, all containing information you may need to know for Step 1. You can also build your own flashcard decks on Osmosis using the[Flashcard Builder](https://www.osmosis.org/flashcards). An added bonus: Osmosis automatically works spaced repetition into your flashcard queue, delivering a method for reviewing concepts that are based on learning science.\\\\n\\\\n### 5. Practice Multimedia Learning\\\\n\\\\nMultimedia learning is when you incorporate written, visual, and audio materials into your learning. This is the essence of learning by Osmosis!\\\\n\\\\nWhen you learn from a variety of sensory stimuli, that information is processed into smaller “bits” which become part of your working memory. Combining the words you read and listen to with visual images helps your working memory process them together as integrated[“chunks”](https://www.osmosis.org/blog/2021/01/04/how-to-set-realistic-goals-for-2021-and-stick-to-them)which moves the concepts into your long-term memory more efficiently and forms stronger links with information you’ve already learned.\\\\n\\\\n![Image 9](https://www.osmosis.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/learning-materials.png)\\\\n### 6. Take Practice Exams\\\\n\\\\nFor a $75 fee, you can visit your local Prometric test center and take a short practice test in the same environment that you’ll take the actual Step 1 exam. These practice tests are shorter than the exam you’ll take on test day, clocking in at around 3.5 hours, but they’re a good way to familiarize yourself with the exam setting. To learn more and register, visit the[USMLE website](https://apps.nbme.org/CBTPSRegistrationWeb/jsp/usmle_CBTPS_registration.jsp).\\\\n\\\\nStep 1 is a long examination, and you need to go in prepared to deal with what can be a physically and mentally exhausting experience. To get a feel for this, you should try to simulate the test environment with at-home practice tests before you take the exam.\\\\n\\\\nThe NBME’s comprehensive self-assessments will help you identify key areas you need to focus on to improve your score. Typically, they’re about 4 hours long—doing two of these back-to-back is grueling, but good training for test day.\\\\n\\\\n[**→****Learn more about NBME self-assessment services.**](https://www.nbme.org/Students/sas/sas.html)\\\\n\\\\nA note about NBME practice tests: many students obsess over their practice test scores and cause themselves undue stress. Think of this as a practice run, not an exact predictor of your Step 1 score.\\\\n\\\\n#### When should I take my Step 1 practice tests?\\\\n\\\\nEvery student will approach practice tests differently. There are a range of approaches, and you should do what works for you. Some students may take a practice test every 2–3 weeks during their dedicated study period, including one at the Prometric test center.\\\\n\\\\nWhatever your approach, try to take a practice test at least a month before the actual exam. This way, if you don’t get a score that is within the range you want, you’ll have time to reevaluate your goals and rethink your strategy with minimal stress.\\\\n\\\\nThe[Osmosis Step 1 Study Schedule](https://www.osmosis.org/study/calendar)will automatically integrate practice exams into your schedule if you create one during the dedicated period, which ranges from 4-8 weeks from your test date. The platform will pick the optimal days for you to take your practice tests.\\\\n\\\\nAre you a little further out from your test date, or maybe you don’t have a date selected yet but still want to incorporate some practice exams into your schedule? The Step 1 Study Schedule allows you to input these dates manually, along with other resources (question banks, books, and videos).\\\\n\\\\n### 7. Maintain Healthy Habits in the Lead-up to the Big Day\\\\n\\\\nKeeping a healthy routine should be part of every study plan. Physical and mental self-care is crucial for thriving in every stage of your medical education, but the months, weeks and days leading up to your first board exam are particularly stressful. Here are a[**few quick tips for maintaining equilibrium****and managing any last-minute exam-day jitters**](https://www.osmosis.org/blog/2019/12/03/how-to-manage-excessive-exam-anxiety)so you feel fully ready to crush Step 1 on test day. And remember: test anxiety is a real (and solvable!) problem that many students face. Check out our[two-part webinar](https://www.osmosis.org/ace-classes-and-boards#webinars)on the topic, and always feel empowered to ask for professional help if you need it.\\\\n\\\\n#### Take Study Breaks\\\\n\\\\nTaking a break will give your brain time to absorb the information for the long term. Once you see your productivity levels starting to flag, it’s time to step away from the books and do something else, even if it’s just for a few minutes. Check out these study tips from Osmosis learners and the team for more information on the value of breaks, plus advice on how to optimize your study space for maximum productivity, and more:\\\\n\\\\n*   [How to maintain productivity in the midst of uncertainty](https://www.osmosis.org/blog/2020/04/06/how-to-maintain-productivity-in-the-midst-of-uncertainty)\\\\n*   [Finding inner peace during a time of turmoil](https://www.osmosis.org/blog/2020/04/17/finding-inner-peace-during-a-time-of-turmoil)\\\\n\\\\n#### Make Sure to Get Some Exercise\\\\n\\\\nPhysical exercise has positive benefits for cognitive performance. It’s also a great way to blow off steam (and manage anxiety). Osmosis learners Abe Baker (University of Illinois College of Medicine, Rockford) and Percy Takyi (Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine) both watch Osmosis videos while they exercise!\\\\n\\\\n*   [Multitasking with Osmosis](https://www.osmosis.org/blog/2019/12/05/multitasking-with-osmosis)\\\\n*   [Establishing Balance in Medical School](https://www.osmosis.org/blog/2019/08/29/establishing-balance-in-medical-school)\\\\n*   [Try This No Equipment At-Home Workout for Students in Quarantine](https://www.osmosis.org/blog/2020/04/30/try-this-noequipment-athome-workout-for-students-in-quarantine)\\\\n\\\\n#### Eat a Healthy Diet\\\\n\\\\nWhen it comes to Step 1 studying, ramen noodles aren’t going to cut it. You need to eat real brain food. Eating a healthy, balanced diet of green vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins will keep you alert and focused.\\\\n\\\\n*   [5 ways to get your health back on track](https://www.osmosis.org/blog/2019/07/05/5-ways-to-get-your-health-back-on-track)\\\\n*   [How to meal plan in medical school](https://www.osmosis.org/blog/2020/01/14/how-to-meal-plan-in-medical-school)\\\\n\\\\n#### Maintain a Regular Sleep Schedule\\\\n\\\\nProper sleep hygiene is important. Going to bed at a consistent time every night will keep your brain well-rested, which helps strengthen connections between ideas.\\\\n\\\\nWhile it might be tempting to sneak in a few flashcards on your phone before bed, try to avoid doing this. Stop studying, switch off, and avoid screens at least an hour before bed.\\\\n\\\\n#### Establish a Support System with Friends and Family\\\\n\\\\n[Maintaining relationships is challenging during medical school](https://www.osmosis.org/blog/2019/02/18/how-to-manage-relationships-while-in-med-school), especially during your Step 1 study period, but it’s very important for your mental well-being. Whoever you choose to be part of your support network, make sure to stay in regular contact with them. Having someone to cheer you on as you reach towards your goals is incredibly motivating!\\\\n\\\\n![Image 10: Healthy habits for medical students.](https://www.osmosis.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/healthy-habits.png)\\\\n#### Celebrate Important Study Milestones\\\\n\\\\nStudying for Step 1 is like a marathon—you have to pace yourself! And every once in a while, that means taking a study break. Small goals are worth acknowledging, and it really helps to have something to look forward to at the end of a period of dedicated review.\\\\n\\\\n#### Stop Studying the Day Before the Exam\\\\n\\\\nNow, this one might be a little controversial for die-hard USMLE preppers. But hear us out.\\\\n\\\\nDedicate the day before the exam to getting yourself into the right headspace. Relax, recharge, and take care of last-minute housekeeping tasks, like figuring out how to get to the test center, checking the weather, and preparing your snacks.\\\\n\\\\nAnd, as a reminder, go to bed on time!\\\\n\\\\n![Image 11: A student having a relaxing day.](https://www.osmosis.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/student-relaxing-day.png)\\\\nUSMLE Step 1 Exam Logistics: What you need to know for the big day\\\\n------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nNow that you’re familiar with what’s on the USMLE Step 1 exam, how to study for it, and how to mentally and physically prepare for it, it’s time to look at practical details, like registering for and taking the exam.\\\\n\\\\n### How do I apply to take Step 1 as a US Student?\\\\n\\\\nTo register for the exam you’ll need to visit the[NBME® Licensing Examination Services](https://apps.nbme.org/nlesweb/#/login)website, input your information, and pay a[$645 registration fee](https://www.nbme.org/students/examfees.html). You’ll then need to coordinate with your institution to have your documents sent to the NBME head office for processing.\\\\n\\\\nAfter you receive your email confirming your three-month testing window, head to the[Prometric website](https://www.prometric.com/usmle)to schedule a specific date.\\\\n\\\\n### How do I apply to take Step 1 as an International Medical Student?\\\\n\\\\nIf you’re an International Medical Student (you attend a medical school outside of the U.S. and Canada), you’ll have to register through the[Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG®)](https://secure2.ecfmg.org/emain.asp?app=iwa).\\\\n\\\\n### Can I reschedule my Step 1 exam date if I need to?\\\\n\\\\nYes. 31 days or more from your scheduled exam date is free, closer to the exam incurs a fee. Get the specifics[here](https://www.usmle.org/apply/rescheduling-fees.html).\\\\n\\\\n### When should I take Step 1?\\\\n\\\\nU.S. medical students typically take Step 1 in April, at the end of their dedicated study period, but it varies by institution. Some students don’t take it until the third year, when they’re in the midst of clinical rotations!\\\\n\\\\nInternational students will often take Step 1 during the summer between their preclinical years and the start of clerkship (e.g. the summer after the second year in a four-year program), or after the fourth year in a six-year program.\\\\n\\\\nWhenever you end up taking Step 1, make sure you give yourself plenty of time for review.[Programs vary](https://www.aamc.org/system/files/c/2/432966-designatedstep1study.pdf)in their allotted Step 1 dedicated period for students. We do recommend beginning your prep 3-6 months before your exam, but on average, 5-8 weeks (or 40 dedicated days, not including weekends or break days) is the recommended amount of time for a dedicated study period. However, now that Step 1 is pass/fail, you may need even less time for a dedicated study period (and programs may subsequently move toward allotting shorter dedicated periods for students).\\\\n\\\\n### Where do I take Step 1?\\\\n\\\\nUSMLE Step 1 exams take place at Prometric test centers around the country. To find where your nearest test center is, plug your ZIP code into[Prometric’s website](https://www.prometric.com/test-takers/search/usmle), and be sure to save Prometric’s[Closures](https://www.prometric.com/closures)page, which is updated daily with any temporary closures due to extreme weather, technical issues, pandemic impacts, or other circumstances. COVID-19 impacted Prometric test centers, but they’ve[reopened for essential tests](https://www.prometric.com/corona-virus-update).\\\\n\\\\n### What can I expect on test day?\\\\n\\\\nYou need to show up for the exam at least 30 minutes before the scheduled time to check in. If you’re late, you won’t be allowed to take the exam. Bring a government-issued ID with a name that matches your scheduling notification. The exam center will provide you with a temporary locker for your belongings, which you can access during your breaks. You’re not allowed to bring anything into the exam room with you, save for your ID, locker key, and soft earplugs, and noise-canceling headphones provided by the test center.\\\\n\\\\n> **Test Day Tips**\\\\n> \\\\n> \\\\n> *   Bring your ID, locker key, soft earplugs, and scheduling permit with you\\\\n> *   Store food and water in a locker for breaks\\\\n> *   Only soft foam earplugs or noise-canceling headphones provided by the test center are allowed\\\\n> *   No electronics (including your phone), notes, or heavy clothing allowed\\\\n> *   You cannot access personal items mid-exam\\\\n\\\\nItems like eyeglasses will be inspected to check for cameras, and all jewelry, with the exception of wedding rings, is forbidden. Empty your pockets, and prepare to be scanned with a metal detector before entering the exam room.\\\\n\\\\n![Image 12](https://www.osmosis.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/prohibited-items.jpg)\\\\n### What is the USMLE Step 1 exam room like?\\\\n\\\\nIn a typical scenario, you’ll enter an exam room that looks like an office space. There will be cubicles with individual computers. You’ll be told which is yours before entering the exam room. If you experience issues with your assigned computer, inform staff immediately.\\\\n\\\\n![Image 13: cubicles with individual computers.](https://www.osmosis.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/cubicles-with-computers.png)\\\\n### What is the USMLE Step 1 test interface like?\\\\n\\\\nThe USMLE Step 1 test interface is pretty simple—you can check out a working version[here](https://orientation.nbme.org/Launch/USMLE/STPF1). We’ve also put together this image highlighting the basic features and their functionality.\\\\n\\\\n![Image 14: USMLE Step 1 testing interface.](https://www.osmosis.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/USMLE-step-1-testing-interface.jpg)\\\\n### How do breaks work during the USMLE Step 1 exam?\\\\n\\\\nUSMLE Step 1 test-takers are entitled to 45 minutes of break time throughout the course of the exam. You can take up to six breaks (i.e. one break between every testing block). You cannot break in the middle of a block.\\\\n\\\\nHow you use your break time is up to you. Some test-takers will take a break every block, while others will take a longer break every two blocks. If you finish a block early, you can leave the exam room, and that time will be added to your break period.\\\\n\\\\nYou can also add to your break period by skipping the 15-minute tutorial session at the beginning of the exam. Test-takers can do the tutorial at home before heading to the test center. If you’re familiar with NBME practice exams (and you should be!) or platforms that use a similar interface, like UWorld, you should also be fine to skip the tutorial.\\\\n\\\\n### What should I bring with me to the Prometric test center?\\\\n\\\\nBring a water bottle and some light snacks to eat between test blocks. Avoid a full lunch, as it could make you sleepy. We recommend healthy foods that will give you quick energy boosts, like:\\\\n\\\\n![Image 15: A student holding a bowl with: nuts, protein bars, cheese, greek yogurt, fruit, jerky.](https://www.osmosis.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/student-holding-a-bowl-of-food.jpg)\\\\n_(Note: When you leave the exam, don’t forget to bring the slip provided by the test center that proves you took the exam—if anything, it’ll serve as a reminder that the whole experience was real!)_\\\\n\\\\n### I have a disability. Can the Prometric test center accommodate my needs?\\\\n\\\\nYes, accommodations can be made for people with physical and learning disabilities, provided the applicant provides full documentation regarding the particularities of their circumstances. You’ll need to fill out an application form and provide a personal statement and copies of professional assessments.\\\\n\\\\nFor a full list of what you need to do to get started, visit the[USMLE test accommodations page](https://www.usmle.org/test-accommodations/).\\\\n\\\\nWhat should I expect after I take USMLE Step 1?\\\\n-----------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n### When will my Step 1 results arrive?\\\\n\\\\nResults are usually available in 3–4 weeks, but delays do occur. The USMLE[says to allow](https://www.usmle.org/pdfs/bulletin/QF_Score_and_Score_Reporting.pdf)at least eight weeks for notification that your score is available. You can find announcements about any potential delays[here](https://www.usmle.org/announcements/). If possible, try to use this time to relax and recharge. You’ve earned it, and at this point, you’ve done everything you can!\\\\n\\\\n![Image 16: A student recharging in his bed.](https://www.osmosis.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/student-sleeping.png)\\\\nDidn’t pass? What’s next?\\\\n-------------------------\\\\n\\\\n> You’re allowed up to **four attempts** at taking Step 1. If you don’t pass:\\\\n> \\\\n> \\\\n> *   Take a deep breath; many students retake successfully\\\\n> *   Tell your advisor\\\\n> *   Rework your study approach and timeline\\\\n> *   Focus on full-length practice exams and areas where you struggled\\\\n\\\\nUnfortunately,[some students do fail](https://www.usmle.org/performance-data/)Step 1 (or the other Step exams) each year. It’s not the best of circumstances— even if you score high on a subsequent attempt, the fact that you failed can impact your residency applications, as there are far more applicants than available residency positions.\\\\n\\\\nIf you fail Step 1, the first thing you should do is take a deep breath: this isn’t the end of your journey, and it’s going to be okay. Take time to examine and accept your feelings, and then look ahead to the future.\\\\n\\\\nNext, tell your advisor. They will help you come up with a recovery plan, delay your clinical rotations if necessary, and arrange a second attempt. Remember to[thank your advisors](https://www.osmosis.org/spreadjoy)for their help!\\\\n\\\\nWhen you’re studying for Step 1 the second time, assess your previous study strategy and adapt. Avoid spending too long on any one subject, and focus on what you don’t know, rather than topics you’re already confident in. Use practice tests to identify your areas of weakness and double down on them to build a more well-rounded knowledge base.\\\\n\\\\n[**→****Learn more about Overcoming Failure in Medical School.**](https://www.osmosis.org/blog/2019/05/03/overcoming-failure-in-medical-school)\\\\n\\\\n**Step 1 isn’t the sole measure of your worth as a residency applicant and future doctor.**There are other factors, including:\\\\n\\\\n*   Writing a compelling personal statement\\\\n*   [Working on a compelling Curriculum Vitae](https://www.osmosis.org/blog/2020/03/10/how-to-build-an-outstanding-curriculum-vitae-during-medical-school)\\\\n*   Sourcing great letters of recommendation from your mentors\\\\n*   Nailing your medical school interviews\\\\n*   [Publishing research](https://www.osmosis.org/blog/2020/02/10/a-list-of-highimpact-medical-education-journals)\\\\n*   Demonstrating strong academic performance\\\\n*   [Showcasing your work and volunteer experience](https://www.osmosis.org/blog/2020/04/23/4-concrete-actions-medical-students-can-take-to-raise-the-line-and-help-fight-covid19)\\\\n*   Having a graduate degree\\\\n\\\\nWhat Makes This Guide AI-Friendly?\\\\n----------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nWe’ve followed Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) best practices to help this content show up in ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews:\\\\n\\\\n*   Clear, natural-sounding answers to real questions\\\\n*   Structured formatting for parsing and summarization\\\\n*   Embedded stats and exam facts\\\\n*   Links to trusted sources like NBME and ECFMG\\\\n*   Written in a tone that sounds human, not robotic\\\\n\\\\nHow Osmosis Helps You Study\\\\n---------------------------\\\\n\\\\nOsmosis gives you a set of tools that help you study smarter, not longer:\\\\n\\\\n*   **Video lessons** that simplify hard topics\\\\n*   **Flashcards** powered by spaced repetition\\\\n*   **Practice quizzes** that mimic Step 1-style questions\\\\n*   A flexible **study schedule tool** to help you plan and stay on track\\\\n\\\\nYou can customize question sets by topic, difficulty, or past performance.
