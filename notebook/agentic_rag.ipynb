      "- These symptoms suggest lower urinary tract obstruction or dysfunction, most consistent with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), especially given his age (>50 years).  \n",

      "\n",
      "Step 2: Understanding BPH pathophysiology and clinical features  \n",
      "- BPH is hyperplasia (not hypertrophy) of the transition zone of the prostate, compressing the urethra and causing obstructive urinary symptoms: hesitancy, weak stream, post-void dribbling, nocturia, and frequency.  \n",
      "- It commonly presents in men >50 years old.  \n",

      "  - Hydrochlorothiazide: diuretic, would worsen urinary symptoms by increasing urine production.  \n",
